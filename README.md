# invert_binary_tree



**Description**
Given the root of a binary tree, invert the tree, and return its root.

**Constraints**
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100]
-100 <= Node.val <= 100

**Scoring**
Solutions must pass all test cases, including edge cases; tests used for grading/scoring will be from the LeetCode testcases.
Fast execution times will be rewarded, but solutions must, first and foremost, be correct and complete.
If more than three languages are submitted, the fastest solution from each of the top three will be considered.
